You will now run a Docker container for Jupyter Notebook.

## Run the Jupyter Notebook 
Some commands will be invoked in the terminal to your right. They pull and run a container containing all necessary packages ot get started with pyspark in a jupyter notebook. 
Moreover, a blank example notebook and some example data used later on will be copied to it. This may take some time, but please hang on. 

Finally, it will print the logs of the container.

This will show something like:
```
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=f89b02dd78479d52470b3c3a797408b20cc5a11e067e94b8
```

The token is the value behind `/?token=`. You need that for logging in.

Next, you can open the Jupyter Notebook at 
 https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Open the `main.ipynb` notebook to start.
