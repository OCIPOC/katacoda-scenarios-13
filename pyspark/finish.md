Congratulations to creating your first PySpark application!

You learned how to import and export data with PySpark and its special dataframe object. You then used this data to create, train and validate a Regression Model to predict oil prices.

It may seem much more important, if you remember, that all this could be done on big clusters, instead of a single machine.

Thanks!
